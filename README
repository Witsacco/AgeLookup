Look up birthdays.

TODO:

* Refactor so that the data is not stored in MasterViewController, but instead in AppDelegate. Reference ScaryBugs for info.

* Revise the table view so it's a bit cleaner and easier to read

* Think about adding "next milestone" to the table view?
  * e.g. "Turns 8 mo. in 4 days", "Turns 13 in 2 weeks"

* Create detail screen

* Fonts?

* Instrument logging? How often is it being used? - "Google Analytics for iPhone apps"

* Deploy to Phone
