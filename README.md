# AgeLookup

An iOS app to look up birthdays.

## TODO

* Refactor so that the data is not stored in MasterViewController, but instead in AppDelegate. Reference ScaryBugs for info.

* Add a sort feature, so you can sort the list alphabetically or by age

* Revise the table view so it's a bit cleaner and easier to read (?)

* Think about adding "next milestone" to the table view?
  * e.g. "Turns 8 mo. in 4 days", "Turns 13 in 2 weeks"

* Add the detail screen, with the person's name, age and birthday

* Better font?

* Instrument logging? How often is it being used? - "Google Analytics for iPhone apps"

* Deploy to Phone

* Design an icon

* Change the name?

* Submit the app to the store for $0.99
